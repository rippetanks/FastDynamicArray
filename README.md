# FastDynamicArray
High performance dynamic vector, optimized to minimize waste of memory.

## Getting Started

To use FastDynamicArray you need to download the two files located under the FastDynamicArray folder. Link and compile the two files together with the files of your project.

To test the project, clone the entire repository and compile it.

### Prerequisites

The FastDynamicArray code is compatible with the C89 standard.

### Installing

Clone the project and into the ```FastDynamicArray folder``` there are the ```header files``` to link and ```.c``` to be compiled together with the files of your project.

## Running the test

Clone the project, compile and run. By default it performs all the tests (unit test and performance test). In ```main.c``` there are two macros that allow you to select the tests you want to perform. For other details see ```Test/Performance/test.h``` and ```Test/UnitTest/unit_test.h.```
